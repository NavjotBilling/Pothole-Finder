-The Pothole founder app is a great way of locating pot holes on the pathway. If a user encounters a pothole on the way, the bump on the road will vibrate the phone and this vibratio on the phone will notify the user of the pothole and store the data into the database. Along with storing the location on the database, it also pinpoints the location of potholes on the map and every pothole found updates the map everytime.
