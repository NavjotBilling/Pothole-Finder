## Description

Pothole founder 

The Pothole founder app is a great way of locating pot holes on the pathway. If a user encounters a pothole on the way, the bump on the road will vibrate the phone and this vibratio on the phone will notify the user of the pothole and store the data into the database. Along with storing the location on the database, it also pinpoints the location of potholes on the map and every pothole found updates the map everytime. 

For the ease of use we have also decided to include a tutorial video for the title page which is fetched from the internet in .3gp format.
